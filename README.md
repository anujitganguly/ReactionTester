## ReactionTester

### Description: This is a small project using javascript that tests the reaction time of user by showing different shapes of differnt colours in different parts of the display. The user needs to tap/click on the visuals and the timer will record the reaction time. The coding and algorithmic part is done by me with the help of some websites and tutorials.

### Tools used: HTML, CSS, Javascript.

#### Features: Responsive (independent of display size and browsing environment).

##### Uses: This project can be used as a mini game for kids. Adults can also use this for some timepass. One of the best use of this project is that, it can be used as a tool to increase our efficiency in multi tasking and fast reacting.

##### Working: The files (namely 'style', 'script' and 'index') should be kept together in a folder and then by clicking on the 'index' file, the project will start working offline. Now, if one wants to run it in server then by uploading the three files in a single folder and then sharing links will also work to use this project.
